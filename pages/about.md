# About

 Hi! I am Oliver Pink and I am looking for a job in the Creative Industries, specifically Games Production & Development. I am studying at East Sussex College for a BSc in Games Development, previously completing my HnD in Games Design. Before this, I completed my T Level in Digital Production for 2 years, learning website development tools (PHP, SQL, JavaScript), games development software (Unreal and Unity Engine), 3D modelling (Blender) and project management skills (Trello and Discord). In my spare time, I like to play video games, watch films or TV shows. I hope that this shows a wide variety of skills and knowledge that could be used. Thank you for reading.
